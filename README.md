# python-ETL-Process

Pyhton ETL project for Data Engineering
This project contains Extract , Transform and Load parts.

This is a Coursera project for Data Engineering.

At first i wrote some functions to read csv ,json and xml files and transform it to panda dataframes. Then transform it the way that 
project wanted (convert US$ market Cap into GBP market Cap).
The load to csv function load the final dataframe into a csv file.
The log function use Y/h/d H:M:S format to save the time of operation with proper message.
